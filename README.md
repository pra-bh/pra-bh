heyyy there i"m @pra-bh!!!

i’m interested in all things tech,
and i'm not quite there yet but i would really like to get into machine learning.

also, i'm also interested in software engineering, (specifically app design, game development) and all sorts of code!
i’m currently learning python (which is what i know most in),
i hope to learn c++, javascript and other languages eventually.

i am looking to collaborate on all sorts of code (typically python atm since im a newbie) to improve and practice!
you can reach me on my email; prabhsthind@outlook.com

see you! :)
